ðŸ’¬ At the moment I am obtaining my masters from the university of WÃ¼rzburg. My focus is on deep learning, especially computer vision in the medical domain.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Self-Supervised Contrastive Learning

âš¡ The projects here are mostly private. Just trying to have fun with new and exciting frameworks/languages.
